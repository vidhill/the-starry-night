## Requirements

- Write a service in go-lang that exposes a web API that, when called, will tell you whether or not the International Space Station is currently visible to those on the earth directly beneath it.

- The space station should be considered visible when the following conditions are met:
  - a) It is after sunset, and
  - b) cloud cover <= 30%

> Useful public APIs to use:
>
> To determine the position of the space station at any instant you can use the API documented here: http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/
>
> To determine local time, sunrise/sunset, and cloud cover, you can use the API documented here: https://www.weatherbit.io/api/weather-current
>
> Note you can sign up for a free key to use this API â€“ it will be limited to 500 calls per day, at a max rate of 1 call/second, which should be enough for this exercise.
>
> Instructions:
>
> Please write the service as you would your production-quality code, including documentation, unit tests, and other measures you would take to ensure the correctness of the code. Also have a think about what V2 of the application might look like.
